\section{Handling Non-Determinism}
\label{sec:nondet}
The typing judgements proposed in Section \ref{subsec:judgements} lead to
ambiguity.
In this section we propose ways to get our derivations to a certain normal
form, by deriving an equivalence relation on our derivation and parsing
trees, based on string diagrams.

\subsection{String Diagram Modelisation of Sentences}
\label{subsec:sd}
String diagrams are the Poincar√© duals of the usual categorical diagrams when
considered in the $2$-category of categories and functors.
In this category, the endofunctors are the natural transformations.
This means that we represent categories as regions of the plane, functors as
lines separating regions and natural transformations as the intersection points
between two lines.
We will change the color of the regions when crossing a functor, and draw the identity functor as a dashed line or no line at all in the following sections.
We will always consider application as applying to the right of the line so that composition is written in the same way as in equations.
This gives us a new graphical formalism to represent our effects using a few equality rules between diagrams.
The commutative aspect of functional diagrams is now replaced by an equality of string diagrams, which will be detailed in the following section.

The important aspect of string diagrams that we will use is that two diagrams
that are planarily isotopic are equal \cite{joyalGeometryTensorCalculus1991}
and that we can map a string diagram to a sequence of computations on
computation: the vertical composition of natural transformations (bottom-up)
represents the reductions that we can do on our set of effects.
This means that even when adding handlers, we get a way to visually see the
meaning get reduced from effectful composition to propositional values, without
the need to specify what the handler does.
Indeed we only look at \emph{when} we apply handlers and natural
transformations reducing the number of effects.
This delimits our usage of string diagrams as ways to look at computations and
a tool to provide equality rules to reduce non-determinism by constructing an
equivalence relationship (which we denote by $\eqcirc$) and yielding a quotient
set of \emph{normal forms} for our computations.

\begin{center}
	\inputtikz{sd-thecatsleeps}
\end{center}

Let us define the category $\mathds{1}$ with exactly one object and one arrow:
the identity on that object.
It will be shown in grey in the string diagrams below.
A functor of type $\mathds{1} \to \mC$ is equivalent to choosing an object in
$\mC$, and a natural between two such functors $\tau_{1}, \tau_{2}$ is exactly
an arrow in $\mC$ of type $\tau_{1} \to \tau_{2}$.
This gives us a way to map the composition of our sentence to a simple string
in our diagram.
Knowing that allows us to represent the type resulting from a sequence of
computations as a sequence of strings whose farthest right represents an object
in $\mC$, that is, a base type.

For simplicity reasons, and because the effects that are buried in our typing
system not only give rise to functors but also have types that are not purely
currifiable, we will write our string diagrams on the fully parsed sentence,
with its most simplified/composed expression.
Indeed, the question of providing rules to compose the string diagram for
\textbf{the} and the one for \textbf{cat} to give the one for \textbf{the cat}
is a difficult question, that natural solutions to are not obvious.
This will be discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:parsing}.
\begin{equation}
	\adjustbox{width=.9\columnwidth}{\ensuremath{\inputtikz{sd-csd-example}}}
	\label{eq:CSD}
\end{equation}

To justify our proposition to only consider fully reduced expressions note that
in this formalism we do not consider the expressions for our functors and
natural transformations but simply the sequence in which they are applied.

In the end, we will have the need to go from a certain set of strings (the
effects that applied) to a single one, through a sequence of handlers, monadic
and comonadic rules and so on.
Notice that we never reference the zero-cells and that in particular their
colors are purely an artistic touch.

A previous modeling of parsers by string diagrams has already been proposed
(\cite{coeckeMathematicalFoundationsCompositional2010},
\cite{wang-mascianicaStringDiagramsText2023}).
We will develop on the differences between those in Section
\ref{subsubsec:diagram-parsing}.

\subsection{Achieving Normal Forms}
\label{subsec:normalforms}
We will now provide a set of rewriting rules on string diagrams (written as
equations) which define the set of different possible reductions and explain
how our typing rules compose diagrammatically.

First, Theorem \ref{thm:isotopy} reminds the main result by
\cite{joyalGeometryTensorCalculus1991} about string diagrams which shows that
our artistic representation of diagrams is correct and does not modify the
equation or the rule we are presenting.
\begin{thm}
	\label{thm:isotopy}
	A well-formed equation between morphism terms in the language of monoidal
	categories follows from the axioms of monoidal categories if and only if it
	holds, up to planar isotopy, in the graphical language.
\end{thm}
We will not prove this theorem here and refer to Theorem 3.1 in \cite{selingerSurveyGraphicalLanguages2010},
and Theorem 1.2 in \cite{joyalGeometryTensorCalculus1991} for proofs.

\medskip

Let us now look at a few of the equations that arise from the commutation of
certain diagrams:
\begin{description}
	\item[The \emph{Elevator} Equations] are a consequence of Theorem
	      \ref{thm:isotopy} but also highlight one of the most important
	      properties of string diagrams in their modeling of multi-threaded
	      computations: what happens on one string does not influence what
	      happens on another in the same time:
	      \begin{equation}
		      \adjustbox{width=.7\columnwidth}{\ensuremath{\inputtikz{sd-elevator}}}
		      \label{eq:elevator}
		      \tag{\emoji{elevator}}
	      \end{equation}

	\item[The \emph{Snake} Equations] are a rewriting of the categorical diagrams
	      equations \eqref{eq:zigzag} and \eqref{eq:zagzig} of Paragraph
	      \ref{par:adjunctions} which are the defining properties of an adjunction.
	      If we have an adjunction $L\dashv R$:
	      \begin{equation}
		      \adjustbox{width=.7\columnwidth}{\ensuremath{\inputtikz{sd-snake1}}}
		      \tag{\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{\emoji{snake}}}
		      \label{eq:snek1}
	      \end{equation}
	      \vspace{-12pt}
	      \begin{equation}
		      \adjustbox{width=.7\columnwidth}{\ensuremath{\inputtikz{sd-snake2}}}
		      \tag{\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{\reflectbox{\emoji{snake}}}}
		      \label{eq:snek2}
	      \end{equation}
	      Note that we could express these equations using the following section,
	      though it is, for now, a bit easier to keep it that way.

	\item[The \emph{(co-)Monadic} Equations] are a rewriting of the equations
	      defining the associativity and the identity properties of a monad.
	      Here we do not present the co-monadic equations which are the
	      categorical dual of those ones.
	      \begin{equation}
		      \inputtikz{sd-monad-unit}
		      \label{eq:unitax}
		      \tag{$\eta$}
	      \end{equation}
	      \begin{equation}
		      \columneq{\inputtikz{sd-monad-mult}}
		      \label{eq:muax}
		      \tag{$\mu$}
	      \end{equation}
\end{description}
Considering the equivalence relation $\mathcal{R}$ freely generated from
$\left\{ \eqref{eq:elevator}, \eqref{eq:snek1}, \eqref{eq:snek2},
	\eqref{eq:muax}, \eqref{eq:unitax} \right\}$ and the equivalence relationship
$\mathcal{R}'$ of planar isotopy from Theorem \ref{thm:isotopy}, we get a set
of normal forms $\mathcal{N}$ from the set of all well-formed parsing diagrams
$\mD$ defined by:
$\mathcal{N} = \left( \mD / \mathcal{R} \right) / \mathcal{R}'$

\subsection{Computing Normal Forms}
Now that we have a set of rules telling us what we can and cannot do in our
model while preserving the equality of the diagrams, we provide a combinatorial
description of our diagrams to help compute the possible equalities between
multiple reductions of a sentence meaning.

\cite{delpeuchNormalizationPlanarString2022} proposed a combinatorial
description to check in linear time for equality under Theorem
\ref{thm:isotopy}.
To provide with more flexibility we use the description provided and change
the description of inputs and outputs of each $2$-cell by adding types and
enforcing types.
In this section we formally describe the data structure we propose, as well as
algorithms for validity of diagrams and a system of rewriting that allows us to
compute the normal forms for our system of effects.

\subsubsection{Representing String Diagrams}
We describe a diagram by an ordered set of its $2$-cells (the natural
transformations) along with the number of input strings, for each $2$-cell
the following information:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Its horizontal position: the number of strings that are right of it (we
	      adopt this convention to match our graphical representation of effects:
	      the number of strings is the distance to the base type).
	\item Its type: an array of effects (read from left to right) that are the
	      inputs to the natural transformation and an array of effects that are
	      the outputs to the natural transformation.
	      The empty array represents the identity functor.
	      Of course, we will not actually copy arrays and arrays inside our
	      datastructure but simply copy labels which are keys to a dictionary
	      containing such arrays to limit the size of our structure, allowing for
	      $\O(1)$ access to the associated properties.
\end{itemize}
We will then write a diagram $D$ as a tuple $\left( D.N, D.S, D.L \right)$
where $D.N$ is a positive integers representing the height (or number of nodes)
of $D$, $D.S$ is an array for the input strings of $D$ and where $D.L$ is a
function which takes a natural number smaller than $D.N - 1$ and returns its
type as a tuple of arrays
$nat = \left( \dnlg{nat}, \dnin{nat}, \dnout{nat} \right)$.
From this, we propose a naive algorithm to check if a string diagram is valid
or not:
\begin{algorithm}[h]
	\caption{Validity Check}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\Function{isValid}{$D$}
		\State{$S \gets \din{D}$}
		\For{$i < \dnb{D}$}
		\State{$nat \gets \dlb{D}{i}$}
		\State{$b, e \gets \dnlg{nat}, \dnlg{nat} + \abs{\dnin{nat}}$}
		\If{$S[b:e] \neq \dnin{nat}$}
		\Return{False}
		\EndIf
		\State{$S[b:e] \gets \dnout{nat}$}
		\EndFor
		\Return{True}
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Note that here the algorithm does not require that all effects are handled for
validity.

\medskip

Our structure can be normalized in polynomial time to check for equality under
Theorem \ref{thm:isotopy} from \cite{delpeuchNormalizationPlanarString2022}.
More precisely, the complexity of our algorithm is in $\O\left( n \times
	\sup_{i} \abs{\dnin{\dlb{D}{i}}} + \abs{\dnout{\dlb{D}{i}}} \right)$,
which depends on our lexicon but most of the times will be linear time,
although this matters when considering Appendix \ref{app:arities-and-denots},
which yields quadratic time.

\subsubsection{Equational Reductions}
We are faced a problem when computing reductions using the equations for our
diagrams which is that by definition, an equality is symmetric.
To solve this issue, we only use equations from left to right to reduce as much
as possible our result instead.
\begin{thm}[Confluence]\label{thm:confluence}
	Our reduction system is confluent and therefore defines normal forms:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Right reductions are confluent and therefore define \emph{right} normal forms for
		      diagrams under the equivalence relation induced by exchange.
		\item Equational reductions are confluent and therefore define \emph{equational}
		      normal forms for diagrams under the equivalence relation induced by exchange.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

Before proving the theorem, let us first provide the reductions for the different
equations for our description of string diagrams.
\begin{description}
	\item[The Snake Equations]
	      First, let us see when we can apply Equation \ref{eq:snek1} to a diagram $D$ which is in \emph{right} normal form, meaning it's been right reduced as much as possible.
	      Suppose we have an adjunction $L \dashv R$.
	      Then we can reduce $D$ along \eqref{eq:snek1} at $i$ if, and only if:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item $\dnlg{\dlb{D}{i}} = \dnlg{\dlb{D}{i + 1}} - 1$
		      \item $\dlb{D}{i} = \eta_{L, R}$
		      \item $\dlb{D}{i + 1} = \epsilon_{L, R}$
	      \end{itemize}
	      This comes from the fact that we can't send either $\epsilon$
	      above $\eta$ (or the other way around) using right reductions and
	      that there cannot be any natural transformations between the two.
	      Obviously Equation \ref{eq:snek2} has almost the same definition.
	      Then, the reduction is easy: we simply delete both strings,
	      removing $i$ and $i + 1$ from $D$ and reindexing the other nodes.
	\item[The Monadic Equations] For the monadic equations, we only use
	      Equation \ref{eq:unitax} as a way to reduce the number of natural
	      transformations, since the goal here is to attain normal forms
	      and not find all possible reductions.
	      We ask that equation \ref{eq:muax} is always used in the direct
	      sense $\mu\left( \mu\left( TT \right),T \right) \to \mu\left(
		      T\mu\left( TT \right) \right)$ so that the algorithm terminates.
	      We use the same convention for the comonadic equations.
	      The validity conditions are as easy to define for the monadic
	      equations as for the \emph{snake} equations when considering
	      diagrams in \emph{right} normal forms.
	      Then, for Equation \eqref{eq:unitax} we simply delete the nodes
	      and for Equation \eqref{eq:muax} we switch the horizontal
	      positions for $i$ and $i + 1$.
\end{description}

\begin{proof}[Proof of the Confluence Theorem]
	The first point of this theorem is exactly Theorem 4.2
	in \cite{delpeuchNormalizationPlanarString2022}.
	To prove the second part, note that the reduction process terminates as
	we strictly decrease the number of $2$-cells with each reduction.
	Moreover, our claim that the reduction process is confluent is obvious
	from the associativity of Equation \eqref{eq:muax} and the fact the other
	equations delete node and simply delete equations.
	Since right reductions do not modify the equational reductions, and thus
	right reducing an equational normal form yields an equational normal form,
	combining the two systems is done without issue, completing our proof of
	Theorem \ref{thm:confluence}.
\end{proof}


\begin{thm}[Normalization Complexity]
	\label{thm:normalize}
	Reducing a diagram to its normal form is done in polynomial time in
	the number of natural transformations in it.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Let us give an upper bound on the number of reductions.
	Since each reduction either reduces the number of $2$-cells or applies at
	most once the associativity of a monad, we know the number of reductions is
	linear in the	number of natural transformations.
	Moreover, since checking if a reduction is possible at height $i$ is done in
	constant time, checking if a reduction is possible at a step is done in
	linear time, rendering the reduction algorithm quadratic in the number of
	natural transformations.
	Since we need to \emph{right} normalize before and after this method, and
	that this is done in linear time, our theorem is proved.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Completeness, Soundness, Decidability}\label{subsubsec:sanity}
Let us do a short check on the well-foundedness of our reduction system.
Clearly from its definition this equivalence system is sound, in that all the
reductions we allow are based on actual equivalence rules, and thus each
reduction step preserves the equivalence relationship.
From the previous Theorem \ref{thm:normalize}, clearly, our system is decidable.
However, there is no reason that our system would be complete.
At this point, we possibly might not have the widest sound reduction system:
there might be more reduction rules that can apply and that would
augment the equivalence classes under the reduction relationship.
Moreover, there is the possibility that the widest sound reduction system is
not computable.
This means that our current systems are decidable, sound but not complete.
