\section{Other Considered Things}
\subsection{Typing with a products Category (and a bit of polymorphism)}
\label{app:prodcat}
Another way to start would be to consider product categories: one for the main type system and one for the effects.
Let $\mC_{0}$ be a closed cartesian category representing our main type system.
Here we again consider constants and full computations as functions $\bot \to \tau$ or $\tau \in \mathrm{Obj}\left( \mC_{0} \right)$.
Now, to type functions and functors, we need to consider a second category:
We consider $\mC_{1}$ the category representing the free monoid on $\mF\left( \mL \right)$.
Monads and Applicatives will generate relations in that monoid.
To ease notation we will denote \emph{functor types} in $\mC_{1}$ as lists written with head on the left.

Finally, let $\mC = \mC_{0} \times \mC_{1}$ be the product category. This will be our typing category.
This means that the real type of objects will be $\left( \bot \to \tau, [] \right)$, which we will still denote by $\tau$.
We will denote by $F_{n} \cdots F_{0} \tau$ the type of an object, as if it were a composition of functions\footnote{It is!}.

In that paradigm, functors simply append to the head of the \emph{functor type} (with the same possible restrictions as before, though I do not see what they would be needed for) while functions will take a polymorphic form:
$x: L\tau_{1} \mapsto \phi x: L\tau_{2}$ and $\phi$'s type can be written as $\star\tau_{1} \to \star\tau_{2}$.

\subsection{Multiple Ways}
\label{app:arities-and-denots}
TODO: : add explanations on how to modify the thing to take more arities,
or whatever the way to define a language is.
