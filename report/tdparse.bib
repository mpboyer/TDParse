  abstract = {This book examines the hypothesis of "direct compositionality", which requires that semantic interpretation proceed in tandem with syntactic combination. Although associated with the dominant view in formal semantics of the 1970s and 1980s, the feasibility of direct compositionality remained unsettled, and more recently the discussion as to whether or not this view can be maintained has receded. The syntax-semantics interaction is now often seen as a process in which the syntax builds representations which, at the abstract level of logical form, are sent for interpretation to the semantics component of the language faculty. In the first extended discussion of the hypothesis of direct compositionality for twenty years, this book considers whether its abandonment might have been premature and whether in fact direct compositionality is not after all a simpler and more effective conception of the grammar than the conventional account of the syntax-semantics interface in generative grammar. It contains contributions from both sides of the debate, locates the debate in the setting of a variety of formal theories, and draws on examples from a range of languages and a range of empirical phenomena.},

Then we give a domain-theoretic denotational semantics of core Eff, using Pitts's theory of minimal invariant relations, and prove it adequate. We use this fact to develop tools for finding useful contextual equivalences, including an induction principle. To demonstrate their usefulness, we use these tools to derive the usual equations for mutable state, including a general commutativity law for computations using non-interfering references. We have formalized the effect system, the operational semantics, and the safety theorem in Twelf.},

  abstract = {Semantic analyses of natural language typically rely on variables for the interpretation of binding relationships. This is true of standard static setups, where sentences might denote sets of variable assignments, as well as standard dynamic ones, where they might denote relations between (sets of) variable assignments. Several well-known alternative frameworks eschew object-language variables in favor of representing semantic dependencies as functional dependencies. This obviates assignments, and has the bene t that any expression's binding needs are discoverable directly from its type. But these popular variable-free approaches are limited to static, in-scope binding relationships, those in which dependents occur in the arguments of their binders. In this paper we develop a semantics that is variable-free in the same sense, but captures traditional notions of dynamic anaphora. We demonstrate the value of anaphoric type transparency with novel analyses of crossover, ellipsis, and sloppy/paycheck anaphora, and compare the new semantics, which introduces the notions of parameterized monads and lenses to the linguistics literature, with other list-based dynamic systems and other accounts of crossover.},

Then, turning this around, we explain how in fact any functor gives rise to a generalized type system, with an abstract notion of typing judgment, typing derivations and typing rules. This leads to a purely categorical reformulation of various natural classes of type systems as natural classes of functors.},

However, the scope of conventional handlers is limited as not all side effects are monadic in nature. This paper generalizes the notion of algebraic effects and handlers from monads to generalized monoids, which notably covers applicative functors and arrows as well as monads. For this purpose, we switch the category theoretical basis from free algebras to free monoids. In addition, we show how lax monoidal functors enable the reuse of handlers and programs across different computation classes, for example, handling applicative computations with monadic handlers. We motivate and present these handler interfaces in the context of build systems. Tasks in a build system are represented by a free computation and their interpretation as a handler. This use case is based on the work of Mokhov et al. [(2018). PACMPL2(ICFP), 79:1--79:29.].},

We further generalise exception handlers to arbitrary algebraic effects. The resulting programming construct includes many previously unrelated examples from both theory and practice, including relabelling and restriction in Milner's CCS, timeout, rollback, and stream redirection.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an extension of the class of plural expressions, a generalized analysis of the denotations of such expressions and a novel account of how they semantically combine with other elements in the sentence. The point of departure is the observation that definite plural DPs and and-coordinations with coordinates of several semantic categories share certain features --- in particular cumulativity---in the context of other plural expressions. Existing analyses of conjunction fail to derive these parallels and I propose that and-coordinations should be analyzed as denoting pluralities (of whatever kind of semantic object their conjuncts denote). This, in turn, raises the question of how pluralities combine with other material in the sentence. I show that a simple expansion of the standard analysis thereof, which puts the workload onto the predicate, is insufficient. I propose an alternative which is based on the idea that all semantic domains contain pluralities and involves plural projection. In this system, the truth-conditions of sentences containing plurality-denoting expressions are not due to the semantic expansion of the predicate (as in existing analyses), but the result of a step-by-step process: Once a plurality enters the derivation, the node immediately dominating it will also denote a plurality, namely of the values obtained by a particular combination of the plurality and the denotation of its sister.

  abstract = {This paper addresses the semantics and pragmatics of singular and plural nominals in languages that manifest a binary morphological number distinction within this category. We review the main challenges such an account has to meet, and develop an analysis which treats the plural morpheme as semantically relevant, and the singular form as not contributing any number restriction on its own but acquiring one when in competition with the plural form. The competition between singular and plural nominals is grounded in bidirectional optimization over form-meaning pairs. The main conceptual advantage our proposal has over recent alternative accounts is that it respects Horn's 'division of pragmatic labor', in that it treats morphologically marked forms as semantically marked, and morphologically unmarked forms as semantically unmarked. In our account, plural forms are polysemous between an exclusive plural sense, which enforces sum reference, and an inclusive sense, which allows both atoms and sums as possible witnesses. The analysis predicts that a plural form is pragmatically appropriate only in case sum values are among the intended referents. To account for the choice between these two senses in context we invoke the Strongest Meaning Hypothesis, an independently motivated pragmatic principle. Finally, we show how the approach we develop explains some puzzling contrasts in number marking between English "three/more children" and Hungarian "h{\'a}rom/t{\"o}bb gyerek" ('three/more child'), a problem that has not been properly accounted for in the literature so far. doi:10.3765/sp.3.6 BibTeX info},

  abstract = {Algebraic effects \& handlers are a modular approach for modeling side-effects in functional programming. Their syntax is defined in terms of a signature of effectful operations, encoded as a functor, that are plugged into the free monad; their denotational semantics is defined by fold-style handlers that only interpret their part of the syntax and forward the rest. However, not all effects are algebraic: some need to access an internal computation. For example, scoped effects distinguish between a computation in scope and out of scope; parallel effects parallelize over a computation, latent effects defer a computation. Separate definitions have been proposed for these higher-order effects and their corresponding handlers, often leading to expedient and complex monad definitions. In this work we propose a generic framework for higher-order effects, generalizing algebraic effects \& handlers: a generic free monad with higher-order effect signatures and a corresponding interpreter. Specializing this higher-order syntax leads to various definitions of previously defined (scoped, parallel, latent) and novel (writer, bracketing) effects. Furthermore, we formally show our framework theoretically correct, also putting different effect instances on formal footing; a significant contribution for parallel, latent, writer and bracketing effects.},

  abstract = {Girard and Reynolds independently invented System F (a.k.a. the second-order polymorphically typed lambda calculus) to handle problems in logic and computer programming language design, respectively. Viewing F in the Curry style, which associates types with untyped lambda terms, raises the questions of typability and type checking. Typability asks for a term whether there exists some type it can be given. Type checking asks, for a particular term and type, whether the term can be given that type. The decidability of these problems has been settled for restrictions and extensions of F and related systems and complexity lower-bounds have been determined for typability in F, but this report is the first to resolve whether these problems are decidable for System F. This report proves that type checking in F is undecidable, by a reduction from semi-unification, and that typability in F is undecidable, by a reduction from type checking. Because there is an easy reduction from typability to type checking, the two problems are equivalent. The reduction from type checking to typability uses a novel method of constructing lambda terms that simulate arbitrarily chosen type environments. All of the results also hold for the {$\lambda$}I-calculus.},

  abstract = {Algebraic effect handlers are a powerful means for describing effectful computations. They provide a lightweight and orthogonal technique to define and compose the syntax and semantics of different effects. The semantics is captured by handlers, which are functions that transform syntax trees.Unfortunately, the approach does not support syntax for scoping constructs, which arise in a number of scenarios. While handlers can be used to provide a limited form of scope, we demonstrate that this approach constrains the possible interactions of effects and rules out some desired semantics.This paper presents two different ways to capture scoped constructs in syntax, and shows how to achieve different semantics by reordering handlers. The first approach expresses scopes using the existing algebraic handlers framework, but has some limitations. The problem is fully solved in the second approach where we introduce higher-order syntax.},
