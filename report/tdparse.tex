\begin{abstract}
	In this report, we will present a Haskell inspired type and effect system to
	model natural language semantics and provide a diagrammatic calculus to help
	with effect handling and parsing in this formalism.
	This allows us to mimic the behaviour of anaphora and quantification directly
	inside the type system.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
I want to thank my mother for the knitting and putting up
with me peeling potato to try knitting with toothpicks; Antoine Groudiev for
his precious insights on the direction the snakes for \eqref{eq:snek1} and
\eqref{eq:snek2} should face;
Paul-André Melliès for his insights; Bob Frank for the help with the
minimalistic merge syntactic theories; and of course, Simon Charlow for his
advising during my time at Yale, and his help around the linguistics questions
that definitely arose.
