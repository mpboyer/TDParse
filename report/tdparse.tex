\title{On a Category-Theoretic Type and Effect Inference Structure for Semantic Denotation Combinations in Natural Languages:\\ Constructing a Purely Functional Semantic Parser of English using a form of Diagrammatic Calculus integrated in Minimalistic Coproduct-based Merge Theories}

\begin{abstract}
	The main idea is that you can consider some words to act as functors in a typing category, for example determiners:
	they don't change the way a word acts in a sentence,
	but more the setting in which the word works by adding an effect to the work.
	The linguistics is based mostly on work by \newcite{bumfordEffectdrivenInterpretationFunctors2025}.

Thanks to Antoine Groudiev for his precious insights on the direction the
snakes for \eqref{eq:snek1} and \eqref{eq:snek2} should face.
Thanks to my mother for her understanding when I asked her if she could take
pictures while knitting for reference for my drawings because knitting using
toothpicks and potato peels didn't cut it.
